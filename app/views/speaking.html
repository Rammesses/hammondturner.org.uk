               <p>It's part of my job as a Technical Lead to help train and mentor
                  development teams - and a big part of that is presenting technical
                  sessions to my colleagues.</p>
               <p>But I've also been very lucky over the last few years to be asked to speak
                  at a number of community developer events and developer groups.
               </p>
               <p>You can see the topics I've spoken on to the right - but I've got
                  plenty more ideas, and am always on the look out for new speaking
                  opportunities.

               <p>Over the last couple of years, I've presented 20 tricks and tips that I've found invaluable as a Tech
                  Lead. But in this session, I want to turn things around and look at applying some of those to solving
                  specific issues that are common within many software development teams.</p>
               <p>I'll be taking lessons learned from the last 2 years of a major development project and using them to
                  illustrate my points.</p>
               <p>We'll look at managing your BAs and PMs and how to balance their need to understand exactly how long
                  everything takes versus your team's need to not be over-pressured by artificial deadlines. We'll see
                  how a structured approach to analysing problems encountered in LIVE can make everyone's life easier,
                  and how to prove whether the problem is (or is not) the fault of your software. And how to handle
                  that inevitable case where it is.</p>
               <p>And we'll look at the problems of implementing uniformity across multiple code-bases and multiple
                  teams delivering multiple releases of multiple features... and where getting your tooling right can
                  give the biggest benefits.</p>

               <p>There's so many parts to Azure, it's sometimes hard to decide what to use and when.
                  Do I use TableStore or CosmosDB? Would BlobStore be better? Should I host a full-fat
                  .Net service in a VM, or stand up an ASP.Net Core WebApi? What about functions?
                  The choices are myriad.</p>
               <p>In this talk I describe how at Landmark we made these kind of decisions as we
                  implemented some new features in our product. I talk about the questions you need
                  to ask to make those decisions, where we went wrong, and how we succeeded in the end.</p>
               <p>I describe in detail how we used CosmosDB, Azure Functions and Service Bus together
                  to provide a Compliance Audit trail feature that would scale properly, work reliably,
                  be trivial to use, and that wouldn't break the bank.</p>

            <div>
               <p>The problem with all DI systems is that configuration generally is pulled in two
                  polar-opposite directions. Either your container is configured by convention
                  (with a few rare exception cases), or it's configured directly and declaratively
                  with masses of registrations.</p>
               <p>For the last few years, I've been using a discovery system for Unity that moves
                  the registrations for dependencies away from the "God Configuration Method" and
                  into individual "Bootstrappers" that live alongside the implementation of the
                  service that they register.</p>
               <p>In this <i>Grok Talk</i>, I introduce a MicrosoftDI version of the "Magic" discovery
                  pattern and show how easy it is to shrink ConfigureServices.</p>

               <p>Microservice architectures are all the rage - hundreds of tiny services, all communicating - built,
                  versioned and deployed independently. But even if your application only has a very few components,
                  as soon as you go for High Availability you're already in that world.</p>
               <p>Enter <strong>Consul.io</strong> - your saviour of service discovery.</p>
               <p>In this session, I'll explain the High Availability architecture employed at Landmark, and how we've
                  use Consul.io to provide discovery, monitoring and load-balancing for our services across an
                  environment
                  that spans two geographically separate data centres.</p>
               <p>And as a bonus, you can potentially get rid of a <i>LOAD</i> of configuration in your app.config or
                  web.config file.</p>

               <p>For any developer, stepping into the role of Tech Lead can be daunting. It’s a big step up from just
                  writing code, and presents challenges in areas that you might not expect.</p>
               <p>A couple of years ago, I came up with 10 specific techniques that I believe can help both new and
                  experienced Tech Leads to succeed. In this session I’ll recap those 10 and give you 10
                  <strong>more</strong>
                  things you should be doing as a Tech Lead.</p>
               <p>This new 10 things are a little more specific, and a little more controversial in places,
                  but they're tried and tested and well worth considering, if not implementing <strong>right
                     now</strong>!</p>

               <p>But as a developer why the heck would you want to use such a DevOps'y tool?</p>
               <p>In this session, I show how using Splunk whilst developing can give insight into your
                  code - how to time transactions, graph volumes and analyse performance - and how
                  Splunking as a developer will make life in production that much easier.</p>

            <p>DevOps is the now very much a "thing" - but keeping your DevOps team happy isn't just about
               working with them on deployments, it's about giving them the tools to support your code in
               production.</p>
            <p>In this talk I set the stage with some real-world experience, and then show you how good logging
               and application monitoring can be easily baked into your code from the start using Serilog,
               Metrics.Net and other helpers, and how Splunk should be your best friend as you bring your
               code to production.</p>

               What should the balance really be?</p>
            <p>And it can also be a complex and thankless role too - particularly if you find yourself becoming

            <p>In this talk I cover (at least) 10 things that I think are essential to success in both areas,
               including how to address technical debt, herd your PMs and make sure your development team has
               a steady flow of work (and beer, pizza or other "motivationals").</p>

               site to a local IIS instance, a "test" server and up to Azure, and how it can be easily integrated
